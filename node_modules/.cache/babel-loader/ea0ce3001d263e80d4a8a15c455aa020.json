I like to use a Lansky guided system for this. It makes it easy to choose an angle and keep it consitent. I generally use 20 degrees per side.\n              <li><b>Test</b></li>\n              Do whatever torture tests you deem necessary for the knife to accomplish based on results of your previous testing of samples or other knives made with the same materials and procedures.\n              <li><b>Make a Sheath</b></li>\n              Traditional leather and the more modern both have advantages and disadvantages.\n              </ul>\n\n\n\n              </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n          <body>\n           \n          </body>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Create;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,qBAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,QAAP,MAAqB,wBAArB;AACA,OAAOC,SAAP,MAAsB,yBAAtB;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,qBAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,qBAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,qBAAlB;;AAIA,SAASC,MAAT,GAAkB;EAChB,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,KAAK,EAAC,WAAX;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,KAAK,EAAC,6BAAX;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAK,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACA;IACI,KAAK,EAAC,gCADV;IAEI,GAAG,EAAEN,KAFT;IAGI,GAAG,EAAC,oBAHR;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EADA,eAME;IACE,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;IAEE,GAAG,EAAEC,QAFP;IAGE,GAAG,EAAC,yBAHN;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EANF,eAWE;IACE,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;IAEE,GAAG,EAAEC,SAFP;IAGE,GAAG,EAAC,+BAHN;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAXF,eAgBE;IACE,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;IAEE,GAAG,EAAEC,KAFP;IAGE,GAAG,EAAC,4BAHN;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAhBF,eAqBE;IACE,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;IAEE,GAAG,EAAEC,KAFP;IAGE,GAAG,EAAC,wCAHN;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EArBF,eA0BE;IACE,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;IAEE,GAAG,EAAEC,KAFP;IAGE,GAAG,EAAC,2BAHN;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EA1BF,CADF,eAiCI;IAAK,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACE;IAAI,KAAK,EAAC,mBAAV;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,YADF,eAEE;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAG;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,mBAAH,sWAEA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,oBAFA,6XAIA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kBAAJ,CAAJ,qjBAEA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kBAAJ,CAFA,qMAIA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,eAAJ,CAJA,mFAMA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,0BAAJ,CANA,+PAQA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,iBAAJ,CARA,kUAUA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kBAAJ,CAVA,qLAYA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,YAAJ,CAZA,+hBAcA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,YAAJ,CAdA,2LAgBA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,kBAAJ,CAhBA,iOAkBA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,mBAAJ,CAlBA,6cAoBA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,aAAJ,CApBA,qSAsBA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,UAAJ,CAtBA,6MAwBA;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAAI;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,mBAAJ,CAxBA,oFAJA,CAFF,CAjCJ,CADF,CADF,eA2EM;IAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EA3EN,CADF;AAiFD;;AAED,eAAeC,MAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
